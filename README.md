### Social Determinants of Substance Misuse – Data Science Project

📊 Project Overview

The "Social Determinants of Substance Misuse" project is a data science initiative aimed at analysing socio-economic factors such as income, education, employment, and housing in relation to substance misuse rates in England. Publicly available datasets from Public Health England (PHE), Office for National Statistics (ONS), and NHS Digital are utilised to uncover socio-economic determinants of substance misuse. The project employs data engineering, visualisation, and predictive analytics to identify high-risk regions and inform targeted interventions for policymakers and public health officials.

🚀 Technologies & Tools

Power BI – Data visualisation and interactive dashboards

KNIME – Predictive modelling and clustering analysis

Excel – Data cleaning, transformation, and integration

Predictive Analytics – Linear regression, K-Means clustering

📈 Key Insights & Findings

Income and Employment: Regions with higher poverty and unemployment rates exhibit significantly higher substance misuse rates, indicating socio-economic vulnerability.

Education: Educational attainment is inversely related to substance misuse, suggesting that targeted educational interventions could reduce risk.

Predictive Models: The K-Means clustering model effectively identifies high-risk zones, categorising regions into low, medium, and high-risk clusters based on socio-economic variables.

Data Visualisation: Visualisations such as correlation matrices and regional heatmaps provide a comprehensive overview of socio-economic risk factors associated with substance misuse.

📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides visual insights into socio-economic determinants of substance misuse, including:

Cluster Analysis: Highlights socio-economic risk factors and substance misuse rates across regions.



Correlation Matrix: Demonstrates the relationship between socio-economic indicators and substance misuse rates.



Substance Misuse by Region: Visualises substance misuse rates by region, focusing on socio-economic risk factors.


✅ Future Enhancements

Advanced Predictive Models: Implement Random Forests and Neural Networks for complex pattern analysis.

Data Integration: Include additional datasets such as crime statistics and community health data.

Interactive Visualisations: Develop dashboards using D3.js or Plotly for enhanced data exploration.

Policy Recommendations: Extend the cost-benefit analysis to quantify potential savings from targeted interventions.
